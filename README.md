## Creating Customer Segments through Unsupervised Learning


In this project, we will analyze a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for internal structure. One goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. Doing so would equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their service to meet the needs of each customer.

Open customer_segments.ipynb on github.com for a read-only view of the analysis. 



### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

I recommend [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 

### Code

The main code for our analysis is provided in the `customer_segments.ipynb` notebook file. Additional supporting code can be found in `renders.py`.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `creating_customer_segments/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```ipython notebook customer_segments.ipynb```
```jupyter notebook customer_segments.ipynb```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is included as `customers.csv`. You can find more information on this dataset on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers) page.
